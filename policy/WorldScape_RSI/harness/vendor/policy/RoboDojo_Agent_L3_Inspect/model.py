"""Compatibility adapter for the standalone L3 inspect policy.

The harness expects every adapter to expose a ``Model``, so this one exists to
answer that contract and to fail loudly if anything ever tries to ask it for an
action: at L3 inspect the only thing that produces actions is the LLM in
``policy.py``.
