# Robot interface

You control two robot arms on a table through the `robo` command. This file describes the interface.
The task is given in your prompt.

## What you can do

- Run `robo` commands in the shell. This is the only way to act on the robot.
- Look at the camera images in `obs/` with your image viewing tool.
- Read `obs/state.json`.
- Keep notes in `notes.md`.

## World frame

One right-handed frame is used for both arms and all cameras. Units are meters, degrees and seconds.

- Origin: on the floor, midway between the two arm bases.
- +x: to the right, as seen from the robot. +y: forward, away from the robot. +z: up.
- The table top is at z = 0.74.
- Left arm base: x = -0.30, y = -0.45. Right arm base: x = +0.30, y = -0.45.
- In the head camera image, +x points to the right of the image and +y points to the top of the image.
- `frame.png` shows the frame from above.

## Gripper

- TCP (tool center point): the midpoint between the two fingertips. All positions refer to it.
- Tool frame, attached to the TCP: x is the direction the gripper points to (`approach_dir`), y is the axis along which the fingers open (`open_dir`), z = x cross y.
- Gripper value: 1 is fully open (8.8 cm between the fingers), 0 is fully closed. The reported value is the commanded opening; whether something is held is visible in the wrist camera.
- At the start both grippers are open, point forward (+y), and are 0.18 m above the table.
- Reach: pointing straight down, the TCP reaches forward to about y = 0.00 at table height, and less higher up. Pointing `down45` it reaches to about y = 0.15. Targets beyond that fail with `ik_unreachable`.

## Commands

| Command | Effect | Costs budget |
|---|---|---|
| `robo obs` | Refresh `obs/` | no |
| `robo move <arm> [--dx M] [--dy M] [--dz M]` | Translate the TCP in the world frame, orientation unchanged. Each axis is clipped to +-0.20 | yes |
| `robo rotate <arm> [--roll D] [--pitch D] [--yaw D] [--frame world\|tool]` | Rotate about the TCP, position unchanged. Roll, pitch, yaw are rotations about x, y, z of the chosen frame, applied in that order. Each is clipped to +-90. Default frame: world | yes |
| `robo point <arm> <down\|forward\|down45> --open <x\|y\|z>` | Make the gripper point down (-z), forward (+y) or 45 degrees between them, with the fingers opening along the given world axis. `--open` is required. Position unchanged | yes |
| `robo gripper <arm> <open\|close\|0..1>` | Set the gripper opening | yes |
| `robo home <arm\|both>` | Return to the start pose | yes |
| `robo wait <sec>` | Let the simulation run, at most 5 s | yes |
| `robo status` | Print the feedback of the last command again | no |
| `robo done` | Declare the task finished. Ends the episode | no |

`<arm>` is `left` or `right`.

Examples:

- `robo move left --dz -0.05` lowers the left TCP by 5 cm.
- `robo point right down --open x` turns the right gripper to point straight down, fingers opening left-right.
- `robo rotate left --yaw 30` turns the left gripper by 30 degrees about the vertical axis through its TCP.
- `robo gripper left 0.5` opens the left gripper halfway.

## Limits

- Command budget: 60 commands per episode.
- Simulation time: limited per task. Every command that moves the robot or waits uses simulation time. `sim_time_left_s` tells how much is left.
- The simulation only runs while a command runs. Thinking costs no simulation time.
- The episode ends when you run `robo done`, when the budget or the simulation time is used up, or when the environment ends it. After that every command returns exit code 3.
- A command can take up to a few minutes of real time to return.

## Output of a command

Every command prints one JSON object.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `requested` | What you asked for |
| `clipped` | true if a value was cut to its limit |
| `workspace_limited` | true if the target was moved back inside the workspace |
| `plan_ok` | false if no motion to the target was found; the arm did not move |
| `plan_fail_reason` | `ik_unreachable`, `self_collision`, `table_collision` or `workspace_limit` |
| `reached_tcp` | Pose of the TCP after the motion: `pos`, `quat` [qw, qx, qy, qz], `rpy` |
| `error_m`, `error_deg` | Distance and angle between the target and the reached pose |
| `settled` | true if the arm came to rest |
| `gripper` | Gripper value after the command |
| `sim_time_s`, `sim_time_left_s` | Simulation time used and left |
| `budget_left` | Commands left |
| `episode_over` | Present and true once the episode has ended |

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 wrong arguments (no budget used), 2 the command failed (budget used), 3 the episode is over, 4 the client timed out (use `robo status`).

Motion planning knows the arm and the table. It does not know the objects on the table.

## Observations

Commands that move the robot refresh `obs/` before they return.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `obs/head.png` | Head camera, 640x480, fixed above the robot, looking forward and down |
| `obs/wrist_l.png` | Camera on the left wrist, 640x480 |
| `obs/wrist_r.png` | Camera on the right wrist, 640x480 |
| `obs/state.json` | State of both arms and the camera parameters |
| `obs/head_depth.npy`, `obs/wrist_l_depth.npy`, `obs/wrist_r_depth.npy` | Depth of the same three images: float32 array of shape (480, 640), metres along the camera z axis (distance to the image plane), 0 where there is no data. Load with `numpy.load` |
| `obs/*_depth.png` | Grayscale preview of the depth: near is bright, far is dark |

`obs/state.json`:

- `left`, `right`: `tcp_pos`, `tcp_quat`, `tcp_rpy` (extrinsic x-y-z, degrees), `approach_dir`, `open_dir`, `gripper`.
- `cameras.<name>.intrinsics`: 3x3 matrix K in pixels.
- `cameras.<name>.extrinsics_world`: 4x4 matrix T that maps camera coordinates to world coordinates. Camera axes: x right, y down, z forward (along the view).
- `cameras.<name>.size`: [width, height].
- `sim_time_left_s`, `budget_left`, `step`.

A world point p is seen at pixel (u, v) with p_cam = inverse(T) * p, u = K[0][0] * p_cam.x / p_cam.z + K[0][2], v = K[1][1] * p_cam.y / p_cam.z + K[1][2].
The other way round, pixel (u, v) with depth d is the world point T * [(u - K[0][2]) * d / K[0][0], (v - K[1][2]) * d / K[1][1], d, 1].

## Extra tools

Some tasks add commands to `robo`. They are described at the end of this file under "Extra tools for this task"; `robo --help` lists them too.

## Rules

- When the task is finished, return both arms to the start pose with `robo home both`, then run `robo done`.
- Run `robo done` only when you are sure the task is finished.
- If a command fails, read its output before you decide what to do next.
- You are not told the positions of the objects. Work them out from the images and the camera parameters.
